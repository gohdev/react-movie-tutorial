- Vite is a lightweight server that allows us to run our React application.

- JSX is a combination of JavaScript and HTML.

- A component is any function in JavaScript that returns JSX code.

- In JSX, rather than having `class`, which is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, we use `className`.

## Setup

```shell
npm create vite@latest frontend --template react
```

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
